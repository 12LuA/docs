Hey, it's been a while since we've given an update about DBL Statistics.

Things are changing around here and it's about time we went into, atleast some, depth about what...

{/* truncate */}

### The infrastructure side of it. 

As many of you know we've been fairly open with the fact that we use MongoDB to store our data... 
we've (mostly Luke:tm:) has come to very much regret that decision. As such we're moving databases.

We're going to be moving to a combination of **PostgreSQL** and **InfluxDB**.
Influx will be housing our time-based data, whilst postgres will be housing the generalistic data (names, descriptions, etc)

Why now? Well when we first started the initial **DBL Statistics v2** rewrite, we went with what we knew.
Which was a combination of EJS, MongoDB and Express. We thought it was time to bring it up to standard with current times.

We're going to answer some very likely questions below and then get to the frontend side.

- Assuming you're going to migrate, will this mean downtime?
  - Unlikely, the way we're going about this will mean that we should be able to accomplish what we're doing with minimum, if any, downtime what so ever.
- Will it increase the sites performance.
  - Ten fold. Initial testing has already garnered 10x faster queries.
- New backend, meaning new frontend?
  - Look below for that :heart:

Fun fact, We'll be documenting how we're going to migrate the massive **1.1 BILLION** documents here on the blog so watch out for that.

### The frontend side of it.

TBD

{/* Xig you're gonna have to write this. Thanks <3 */}

### This title can't be changed until we announce big secret

TBD

{/* Need to plan a group meeting to write this. <3 */}
