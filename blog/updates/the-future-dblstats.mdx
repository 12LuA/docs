## Things are changing
Hey, it's been a while since we've given an update about DBL Statistics.

Things are changing around here and it's about time we went into, atleast some, depth about what...

Keep up to date by joining our Discord Server: https://discord.gg/jjEauJXuZc

### Our name
As we build our new site, we want a name that represents more of what we do and be more up to date, therefore we are changing our name to TopStats. With this name change, we will be getting a new redesign and a faster site.

### Our Domain
Once the new site has been released, you will be able to access it at https://topstats.gg, there will be a migration period, where DBLStatistics.com will still be hosted,

## The infrastructure side of it.

### Our API
We'll be updating our API, to be faster, higher ratelimits, with more features, newer docs and a better ecosystem, to allow you to do more with the data we provide. A blog post will come detailing this change in the coming weeks.

### Our Databases

As many of you know we've been fairly open with the fact that we use MongoDB to store our data...
we've (mostly Luke:tm:) has come to very much regret that decision. As such we're moving databases.

We're going to be moving to a combination of **PostgreSQL** and **InfluxDB**.
Influx will be housing our time-based data, whilst postgres will be housing the generalistic data (names, descriptions, etc)

Why now? Well when we first started the initial **DBL Statistics v2** rewrite, we went with what we knew.
Which was a combination of EJS, MongoDB and Express. We thought it was time to bring it up to standard with current times.

We're going to answer some very likely questions below and then get to the frontend side.

- Assuming you're going to migrate, will this mean downtime?
  - Unlikely, the way we're going about this will mean that we should be able to accomplish what we're doing with minimum, if any, downtime what so ever.
- Will it increase the sites performance.
  - Ten fold. Initial testing has already garnered 10x faster queries.
- New backend, meaning new frontend?
  - Look below for that :heart:

Fun fact, We'll be documenting how we're going to migrate the massive **1.1 BILLION** documents here on the blog so watch out for that.

## The frontend side of it.

Our new web stack will now be in React using Chakra UI. We've decided to migrate off of EJS and pure HTML, largely due to the pain of having to maintain and the effect it had on our ability to provide newer features.

With this you can expect a nice clean new ui, with up-to-date features and no more waiting 9 seconds for your graphs to load.

With love :heart:

Xignotic, Marco, Luke
